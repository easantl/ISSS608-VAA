## Getting Start

### **Installing and loading the required libraries**

```{R}
pacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, 
               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,
               tidyverse, graphlayouts, 
               concaveman, ggforce, jsonlite, dplyr)
```

### **Importing data**

```{R}
t_data <- fromJSON("data/MC1_graph.json",
                   simplifyDataFrame = TRUE)
```

## 1. Introduction

Sailor Shift is one of the most influential figures in the development of “Oceans Folk” music. From her humble beginnings as a singer on Oceanus Island to her current status as a global superstar, she has grown to represent not only her own personal success, but has also propelled this niche genre into the world. This project uses data analysis and visualization to delve deeper into her network of collaborations, musical influences, and her importance in the overall music ecosystem. We will reveal how she has influenced others and been shaped by the zeitgeist, and further reflect on what her rise reveals about the new generation of musicians.

## 2. Data processing

### 2.1. Extracting Edges and Nodes

```{R}
nodes_tbl <- as_tibble(t_data$nodes)
edges_tbl <- as_tibble(t_data$links) 
```

### 2.2. Get closer to data

#### 2.2.1. Edges

![](Pics/Edges.png){width="298"}

```{R}
glimpse(edges_tbl)
```

```{R}
length(unique(edges_tbl$`Edge Type`))

unique(edges_tbl$`Edge Type`)

```

The edges dataset contains 37,857 records and 4 fields to represent the various relationships between entities in the network. Each edge contains the node IDs (source and target) of the starting and ending points, as well as 12 Edge Types describing the nature of the relationship, such as “PerformerOf”, ‘ComposerOf’ or “RecordedBy”. Meanwhile, the key field is used to distinguish between multiple connections between the same node pair.

#### 2.2.2. Nodes

![](Pics/Nodes.jpg){width="542"}

```{R}
glimpse(nodes_tbl)
```

The nodes dataset contains 17,412 entries, each representing an entity within the music network and categorized under the Node Type column as "Person", "Song", or "RecordLabel". Each node includes relevant attributes based on its type—for example, songs have fields such as single, release_date, genre, and notable, while people may have stage_name and notoriety_date. The presence of missing values (NA) in many fields indicates that certain attributes are only applicable to specific node types.

#### 2.2.3. **Initial EDA**

```{R}
ggplot(data = edges_tbl,
       aes(y = `Edge Type`)) +
  geom_bar()
```

This bar chart above shows the distribution of different edge types in the music relationship network. The most common type is PerformerOf, indicating that the data heavily captures who performed which work. Other frequent types include ComposerOf, LyricistOf, and ProducerOf, highlighting the importance of creative and production roles. In contrast, relationships like MemberOf and DirectlySamples are less common, suggesting these connections are either rarer or less documented.

```{R}
ggplot(data = nodes_tbl,
       aes(y = `Node Type`)) +
  geom_bar()
```

This bar chart displays the distribution of different node types in the music network dataset. The most common type is **Person**, with a count far exceeding other categories, indicating a strong focus on individual artists, producers, and contributors. **Songs** also appear in large numbers, highlighting the dataset’s emphasis on works being created or performed. Other types like **Albums**, **RecordLabels**, and **MusicalGroups** are present but in significantly smaller quantities.

## **3. Creating Knowledge Graph**

### 3.1. **Mapping from node id to row index**

```{R}
id_map <- tibble(id = nodes_tbl$id,
                 index = seq_len(
                   nrow(nodes_tbl)))
```

### **3.2. Map source and target IDs to row indices**

```{R}
edges_tbl <- edges_tbl %>%
  left_join(id_map, by = c("source" = "id")) %>%
  rename(from = index) %>%
  left_join(id_map, by = c("target" = "id")) %>%
  rename(to = index)
```

### **3.3. Filter out any unmatched (invalid) edges**

```{R}
edges_tbl <- edges_tbl %>%
  filter(!is.na(from), !is.na(to))
```

### **3.4. Creating tidygraph**

```{R}
graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes_tbl, 
                   edges = edges_tbl, 
                   directed = t_data$directed)
```

```{R}
class(graph)
```

## **4. Visualising the knowledge graph**

```{R}
set.seed(1234)
```

### **4.1. Visualising the whole graph**

```{R}
ggraph(graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.3, 
                 colour = "gray") +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = `Node Type`), 
                  size = 4) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), 
                 repel = TRUE, 
                 size = 2.5) +
  theme_void()
```

### **4.2. Visualising the sub-graph**

#### **4.2.1. Filtering edges to only “MemberOf”**

```{R}
graph_memberof <- graph %>%
  activate(edges) %>%
  filter(`Edge Type` == "MemberOf")
```

#### **4.2.2. Extracting only connected nodes (i.e., used in these edges)**

```{R}
used_node_indices <- graph_memberof %>%
  activate(edges) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(from, to) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  unique()
```

#### **4.2.3. Keeping only those nodes**

```{R}
graph_memberof <- graph_memberof %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(row_id = row_number()) %>%
  filter(row_id %in% used_node_indices) %>%
  select(-row_id)  # optional cleanup
```

#### **4.2.4. Plotting the sub-graph**

```{R}
ggraph(graph_memberof, 
       layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.5, 
                 colour = "gray") +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = `Node Type`), 
                  size = 1) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), 
                 repel = TRUE, 
                 size = 2.5) +
  theme_void()
```

## 5. Sailor Shift’s Career Connections

### 5.1. The contributors who shaped the modern Sailor Shift
